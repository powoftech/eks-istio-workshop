Every good project needs a home.

1. **Go to GitHub** (or your preferred Git provider).

2. **Create a new, public repository.** Name it something like `secure-container-pipeline`.

3. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd secure-container-pipeline
```
