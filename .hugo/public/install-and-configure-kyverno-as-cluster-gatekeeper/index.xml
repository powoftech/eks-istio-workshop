    <title>Install and Configure Kyverno as a Cluster Gatekeeper :: Container Registry Security with Vulnerability Scanning and Policy Enforcement</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/install-and-configure-kyverno-as-cluster-gatekeeper/index.html</link>
    <description>Our goal here is to make the cluster self-defending. The pipeline we built is great, but it doesn’t stop someone with kubectl access from manually deploying an insecure container. We will now install a gatekeeper–an admission controller–to enforce our rules on every single workload that tries to run on the cluster.&#xA;Our tool for this is Kyverno. It’s powerful, Kubernetes-native, and the policies are just simple YAML, making it perfect for our project.</description>
