    <title>Install and Test Falco for Runtime Threat Detection :: Container Registry Security with Vulnerability Scanning and Policy Enforcement</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/install-and-test-falco-for-runtime-threat-detection/index.html</link>
    <description>We will focus first on the runtime security piece. Our mission is to detect and alert on suspicious activity within our running containers in real-time.&#xA;Our tool for this is Falco, the CNCF open-source standard for cloud-native runtime threat detection. It acts like a security camera that watches system calls and alerts you when a container does something it shouldnâ€™t.&#xA;Install Falco using Helm Just like with Kyverno, Helm is the most straightforward way to deploy Falco and its components.</description>
